iDO: Compiler-Directed Failure Atomicity for Nonvolatile Memory.
	Eliminating the need to log every persistent store

Persistence Parallelism Optimization: A Holistic Approach from Memory Bus to RDMA Network.
	improve the persistence parallelism in the memory bus and
the RDMA network.
	
Efficient Hardware-Assisted Logging with Asynchronous and Direct-Update for Persistent Memory. 
	redo-based logging (ReDU), which performs direct and asynchronous in-place data update to NVM.

Fine-Grain Checkpointing with In-Cache-Line Logging.
	quickly recoverable data structure in NVM after a system failure,enables recovery of earlier state without requiring cacheline flushes in the normal case.
